### Thanks for visiting my page! 
I'm so happy to introduce myself to you. üòä   
You can read this README in Korean at this <b><a href="">page</a></b>.

### Preferred Programming Languages
* Python 
  * I like it because it allows me to think <i>"Pythonically".</i>
  * List Comprehension : it is more intuitive than <i>Map or Filter.</i>
  * Inner function also helps think <i>"Functionally" and use Closure naturally. </i>
  * Python is an <i>interpreter</i> language that makes me start any project or mock faster.
  * With many built-in functions and a standard library, I don't have to <i>reinvent the wheel.</i>
* Java
  * I like Spring Framework because it's design philosophy. To use this framework, I have to use Java or Kotlin.
  * Yes, I'm interested in Kotlin too, so have planned to study Kotlin.
  * As well as functional programming, I'm interested in object-oriented Programming.
  * And Java is a very object-oriented Language, so I like it.
* JavaScript
  * I was reluctant to use JS because it had many problems.
  * But over time, JavaScript has evolved. Many developers have made the evolution.
  * I'm interested in ECMA2016~ and NodeJs, the JavaScript runtimes.
  * And if I make a web client application (and also server application) using JS is needed.
### Languages I'm into üòé
<table>
<td> <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> </td>
<td> <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> </td>
<td> <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> </td>
<td> <a href="https://dart.dev/">Dart</a> </td>
</table>

If there is a more easy or simple way(e.g. Language, Framework, Tools, Programs) to make a program, I am always ready to learn them.

### Field of interest
* I'm interested in web services, both backend ,and frontend. 
* functional programming and object-oriented programming paradigm.
* Automata and Computational Logic.
* Statistics.
